# Machine Learning in CO2 reduction

## Research Questions
- Determine the relationship between available parameters and target (faradaic efficiency, FE)?.
- Develop accurate predictive model for the FE response.
- Explain the impact of the features on the FE response.
- Design novel conditions with the proposed ML-based models.

## To-Do
- [x] Clean and perform preliminary analysis on the data. 
- [x] Train ML model using methods such as ANN, RF, XGB, etc.
- [x] Use best model to perform feature analysis.
- [x] Deploy the model to [app](https://reductelectro.streamlit.app).
- [x] Verify model predictions with new experiments.
- [x] Propose novel optimized experimental conditions for assessment.
- [ ] Prepare manuscript
