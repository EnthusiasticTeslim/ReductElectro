# Machine Learning accelerate CO2 reduction

## Research Questions
- Are there any relationship between available parameters (current density, pH, Sn % and potential) and target (faradaic efficiency, FE)?
- Can we develop an accurate predictive model for the different FE response?
- Can you explain the impact of the features on the model response? 
- Can you design new materials with the proposed ML-based models?
